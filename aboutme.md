I am a  Veterinary Researcher with strong background in Bioinformatics and Animal Genomic at the Animal Breeding and Genomics at Wageningen University and Ausnturia company.

I'm currently working on goat milk oligosaccharides and Optibov project analyzing whole genome sequences, pipeline development, and supporting different projects.

Here you can find some codes from my daily work, as well as some tips I come across.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now ....
