I wanted to create a very basic guide to perfom a GWAS for people without knowledge about bioinformatics (like me). In this script:  (https://github.com/rprendes/common-use-scripts/blob/main/script.GWAS_MixedModel.sh) you can find the steps.

It covers from imputs from plink to plot the results using this software https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3386377/ in unix and qqman library in R.
